# Minigames-Lib 2.0 - Introduction

The old Minigames-Lib from InstanceLabs was already great. But it was hard to maintain and fix bugs.
Realizing new features and games that behave different from standard was difficult.

InstanceLabs was already dreaming of doing automated testing. However this is very difficult in
minecraft servers.

So I decided to completely rewrite the library using modern patterns and java 1.8 features.

Main features of the library:

* Arenasystem
* Customizable messages
* Different minigame types
* VIP arenas
* Economy, command and item rewards
* Overall Customization/Attributes like player counts, countdowns, spawns, boundaries etc.
* Signs and corresponding Arena states
* Fast map regeneration mechanism
* Kits/Classes and Classes Gui
* Arcade system
* MySQL/SQLite support
* Guns API (unfinished and only in use in Warlock Tactical right now)
* Bungee support including signs
* Party (/party)
* Achievements
* Additional shops with Gui
* Included effects like blood or dead bodies lying around
* Holograms and Scoreboards

New features of the library in version 2.0:

* Multi-language support 
* Declarative arena and game types, use game rules instead of writing code
* Multiple arena zones/locations with individual rules 
* Smart administration Gui
* Persistent game states
* Better support for Bungee-Clusters and Multi-World systems
* Gaming votes
* Arena groups
* Map rotation
* Highscores
